release_summary: |
    This release focused primarily on improving the code base for maintainability by relegating tasks to appropriate roles
    which significantly improved code reuse. While many of the role changes introduce improvements to inventory configuration
    options, backwards compatibility has been retained. Note that this release will now require Ansible 2.10 or later.
